Hey! Anushreya here.
I am a student of class 8th with bug dreams.
I am a Pianist, Guitarist and a Singer but most importantly a Coder.
I know JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSX and Python.
I love editing images & videos, but the thing I love the most is Miraculous a tale full of miracles.
I spend my free time in making some Miraculous Fanarts and designing wireframes of games & apps related to it.
Lastly, never let anyone know that you are actually broken inside, keep your charm up and shine as the sun, everything will be fine automatically.
